# Do Expensive Beauty Products Really Deliver Higher Satisfaction?
## 1. Background
In the beauty industry, higher prices are often perceived as a signal of superior quality.
Premium products are commonly assumed to deliver better customer experiences simply because they cost more.

However, customer satisfaction is ultimately shaped by actual product performance rather than price alone.
This project explores whether higher-priced beauty products genuinely receive higher customer ratings using Sephora product-level data.

## 2. Project Objective
The objective of this project is to evaluate the relationship between product price and customer satisfaction.
Specifically, the analysis aims to answer:
- Do more expensive beauty products receive higher average ratings?
- Does customer satisfaction increase consistently as prices rise?
- How much variation exists in ratings within the same price range?
- Which brands successfully combine premium pricing with high customer satisfaction?

## 3. Dataset
Source: Sephora Products and Skincare Reviews(Kaggle)

Key fields:
- Price
- Customer rating
- Number of reviews
- Brand name
- Product category

## 4. Data Cleansing
Data preparation was performed using SQL to ensure reliability and consistency.

Key steps included:
- Removing products with missing or invalid prices
- Excluding products without ratings
- Filtering out products with fewer than 10 reviews to reduce rating noise
- Selecting only analysis-relevant fields

## 5. Visuals and Insights
### 5-1. Higher Prices Do Not Lead to Meaningfully Higher Ratings
- No clear upward trend in ratings as prices increase
- Ratings plateau or fluctuate beyond certain price levels
### 5-2. Customer Ratings Do Not Increase Consistently as Prices Rise
- No clear upward trend in ratings as prices increase
- Ratings plateau or fluctuate beyond certain price levels
### 5-3. Customer Satisfaction Varies Widely Within the Same Price Range
- Large variation in ratings exists within identical price ranges
- Both high- and low-rated products appear at all price levels
- Price alone is insufficient to explain customer satisfaction
### 5-4.Only a Few Brands Achieve Both Premium Pricing and High Ratings
- A small number of brands combine high prices with consistently high ratings
- Many mid-priced brands perform as well as, or better than, premium brands
- Premium pricing without strong performance presents a reputational risk

## 6. Strategic Recommendations
### 6-1. Emphasise Performance Signals Over Price
Customer ratings, review counts, and popularity indicators should be highlighted more prominently than price alone to support informed purchasing decisions.
### 6-2. Position Mid-Priced Products as “Value Premium”
Mid-priced products often deliver satisfaction comparable to premium items and represent strong value propositions worth emphasising.
### 6-3. Support Premium Positioning with Consistent Performance
Premium brands should maintain consistently high ratings to justify pricing and avoid negative perception.

## 7. Conclusion
This project demonstrates that higher prices do not consistently translate into higher customer satisfaction.
Product performance signals such as ratings and reviews provide more reliable guidance for both customers and business decision-makers.
